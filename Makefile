--Targets--

all: Attempt to run gofmt golint and if those pass then it will pull in the latest
     dependencies and build the requested binaries. If the build completes without
     errors and taball is created and dropped into the targetdir.
		 Ex. `make pkg=<package> all`

build: Run gox with a pre-defined set of options. By default a binary will be built
       for linux/amd64, named the same as the srcdir, and any output will be placed
       in ./bin. Ex. `make pkg=<package> build`

clean: Remove any files that are used or produced during the building and packaging
       steps. This will include the binary and tarball themselves as well as the
       directories that these would get dropped into. `make clean`

coverage: This needs to be implemented.

dist :Create a compressed tar archive of all binary produced during the build steps.
      The tarball will be placed into the directory defined by the <targetdir> make
      variable. Ex. `make pkg=<package> dist`

format: Run the gofmt tool. This will produce a list of files that do not conform
        to the standards set via golang. If you want to attempt to fix these errors
        automatically see the <format_correct> task.

format_correct: Attempt to automatically correct any issues presented via the gofmt
                tool.

install:  Install any binaries and info files into the directories specified by the
         <destdir> and <infodir>. Ex. `make pkg=<package> install`

info:  Build any texinfo documents found. Ex. `make pkg=<package> info`

help:  Display this help message. Ex. `make help`

lint:  Run the golang linting tool. Ex. `make pkg=<package> lint`

maintainer_clean: This needs to be implemented.

pre-build: Ensure that the necessary directories present. This does not need to be
           called by the user.

pre-dist: Ensure that the necessary directories present. This does not need to be
          called by the user.

test: This needs to be implemented.

test-all: Run all optional testing targets.

--Variables--

infodir Set the location for installing GNU info files.
        Default: /usr/local/share/info

pkg Set the package to build. Ex. `make pkg="bobogono" build`
        Default: .

srcdir Set the src directory.
       Default: ../

pkgbase Set the base package location.
        Ex. `make pkgbase="github.com/yieldbot"` build
        Default: github.com

target Set the path that the tarball will be dropped into. DrTeeth will look in
       ./target by default but golang will put it into ./pkg if left to itself.
       Default: target

destdir Set where the local binary should be installed to for testing purposes.
        Default: /usr/local/bin
